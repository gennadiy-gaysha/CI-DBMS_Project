# in this one-to-many connection, meaning it sort of reverses and becomes many-to-one.
# It needs to back-reference itself, but in quotes and lowercase, so backref="category".
# Also, it needs to have the 'cascade' parameter set to 'all, delete' which means it will find
# all related tasks and delete them.
# The last parameter here is lazy=True, which means that when we query the database for
# categories, it can simultaneously identify any task linked to the categories.
